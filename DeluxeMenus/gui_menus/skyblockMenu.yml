#     - 'RED;BASE'
#     - 'WHITE;CREEPER'
#     lore:
#     - 'placeholders can be used in the name and lore'
#     - '%<any placeholder from Papi>% shows the viewer values'
#     enchantments: valid enchantment names can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html
#     - '<ENCHANTMENT>;<LEVEL>'
#     - 'SILK_TOUCH;1'
#     left_click_commands:
#     - '[close]'
#     right_click_commands:
#     - '[player] spawn'
# 
# All keys aside from update_interval are required for this menu to be valid and loaded!
# The only options for an item to be considered valid are material and slot!
# 
# banner_meta must be listed with a specific format:
# banner_meta:
# - <DyeColor>;<PatternType>
# 
# Valid DyeColor names can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/DyeColor.html
# Valid PatternTypes can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/block/banner/PatternType.html
# ==============================================================
# 
# Click requirement information
# 
# You can now add 'click requirements' to left and right click commands!'
# These are defined per item and must follow a specific format:
# 
#   'item_one':
#     material: DIAMOND
#     slot: 3
#     left_click_commands:
#     - '[close]'
#     - '[message] You were charged 100 dollars for clicking that item!'
#     - '[console] eco take %player% 100'
#     left_click_requirement:
#       expression: '%vaulteco_balance% > 100'
#       deny_commands:
#       - '[close]'
#       - '[message] &cYou dont have 100 dollars to click that item'
#     right_click_commands:
#     - '[close]'
#     - '[message] You had permission to click that item!'
#     right_click_requirement:
#       expression: 'BukkitPlayer.hasPermission("some.permission.toclick")'
#       deny_commands:
#       - '[close]'
#       - '[message] &cYou dont have permission to click that item'
# 
# Every left/right_click_requirement MUST have an expression specified that would return a boolean (true/false)
# These expressions must also follow JavaScript format as they are all javascript based!
# 
# deny_commands: are optional and will be executed if the expression returns false.
# You may use placeholders in your Javascript expressions to evaluate if the player meets the requirement or not.
# You may also use a few keywords which give you access to the Player class and Bukkit.Server class if you understand the Bukkit API
# 
# BukkitPlayer - references the Player object your expression is evaluating.
# BukkitServer - references Bukkit.getServer() in the Bukkit API.
# 
# The choice to use this system to evaluate if a player meets requirements to click an item was an easy choice.
# This way I do not have to hook into every plugin to check if a player meets the requirement to click an item successfully.
# You can simply use placeholders, or the keywords provided to give you access to the Player and Server objects.
# If you want to check if a player has enough money, simply use an expression like so:
# 
# expression: '%vaulteco_balance% >= 100' (checks if players balance is greater than or equal to 100)
# If you want to charge the player, simply run the economy command to take the amount from the players balance in your click_commands
# which will be executed if the player meets the requirement!
