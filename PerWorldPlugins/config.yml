# This config controls what plugins work on certain worlds.
# Example
# limit:
#   WorldEdit:
#     - world
#     - world_nether
#   Essentials: []
# This will make it so worldedit will only work in world & world_nether, meaning in the end it is not usable.
# When there is no worlds in the list it will allow it for any worlds, in this example allowing all worlds.
# Whenever a plugin is added, this config will automatically add it!
# exempt-login-events is for excluding login events when true, this means if a plugin uses PlayerLogin it will allow it for any world. We advise this to be enabled!
# blocked-msg is the string displayed to a client when a command is blocked
# check-for-updates is the controller for if updates should be alerted to the users with the permissions/op.
exempt-login-events: true
check-for-updates: true
blocked-msg: '&c[Error] This command cannot be performed in this world.'
